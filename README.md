Faith Lee is a local photographer who captures a side of her clients that is not often seen. The purpose behind this website is to give Faith a platform to promote her work and expand her horizons in business. She has previously used social medias, like Instagram, to showcase her work but, we felt her talent deserved more recognition and building a website for her would be the best way to share her work.
<p>This website was created by Sarah Lancaster and Mia Hartsfield.</p>
<p>Some interesting features on the website include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean and elegant color scheme and font</li>
  <li>Logo works as a link to the homepage</li>
  <li>Links change to a light gray when hovered over</li>
  <li>Instagram and other contact options in the footer</li>
  <li>Information about Faith so clients know a little bit about who they will be working with</li>
  <li>Contact form to book a photoshoot</li>
  <li>Two carousels that lead to her portfolios to show her range</li>
  <li>Explanation of the process so clients have an idea of how the photoshoots will run</li>
  <li>Unique portfolio layout</li>
  </ul>
<p>Thank you for this wonderful oppurtunity and taking our website into consideration!</p>
